# Bootstrap Kubernetes

## kubeadm

**kubeadm** is a tool for creating Kubernetes clusters.

**kubeadm** performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable cluster up and running. 

By design, it cares only about bootstrapping, not about provisioning machines. 

Likewise, installing various nice-to-have addons, like the Kubernetes Dashboard, monitoring solutions, and cloud-specific addons, is not in scope.

| command | description |
|-------- | ----------- |
| ***kubeadm init*** | to bootstrap a Kubernetes control-plane node |
| ***kubeadm join*** | to bootstrap a Kubernetes worker node and join it to the cluster |
| ***kubeadm upgrade*** | to upgrade a Kubernetes cluster to a newer version |
| ***kubeadm config*** | if you initialized your cluster using kubeadm v1.7.x or lower, to configure your cluster for kubeadm upgrade |
| ***kubeadm token*** | to manage tokens for kubeadm join |
| ***kubeadm reset*** | to revert any changes made to this host by kubeadm init or kubeadm join |
| ***kubeadm version*** | to print the kubeadm version |
| ***kubeadm alpha*** | to preview a set of features made available for gathering feedback from the community |
